# Airflow_DataPipelines

# background
MTN Rwanda, has a vast customer base, and  generates a large amount of data daily. We must efficiently process and store this data to make informed
business decisions. Therefore, we plan to develop a data pipeline to extract, transform, and load data from three CSV files and store it in a Postgres database. We require a skilled data engineer who can use the Airflow tool to develop the pipeline to achieve this.

# problem statement
The main challenge is that the data generated is in a raw format, and we need to process it
efficiently to make it usable for analysis. This requires us to develop a data pipeline that can extract, transform and load the data from multiple CSV files into a single database, which can be used for further analysis.

# Best Practices used

1. DAG configuration: The DAG configuration is well defined with appropriate default arguments, start_date, and schedule_interval. Default arguments include details such as owner, retries, and retry delay. This helps to ensure the pipeline's reliability, recoverability, and maintainability.

2. Modularization of tasks: The tasks of the pipeline are divided into three separate functions - extract_data, transform_data, and load_data. Each function has a specific responsibility, which makes the code more modular and easier to understand, maintain, and test.

3. Data validation and error handling: The code includes data validation and error handling techniques such as checking for the existence of input files, handling exceptions, and logging errors. This helps to ensure the pipeline's robustness and reliability, as well as to provide meaningful feedback in case of any issues that may arise during execution.



# Recommendations
1. Security: To ensure the security of the pipeline, it is recommended to follow security best practices such as encrypting sensitive data, limiting access to resources, and using virtual private clouds (VPCs) or other isolation mechanisms. It is also recommended to regularly patch and update the software used in the pipeline and use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to secure access to cloud-based resources.
2. Monitoring and alerting: To ensure that the pipeline is running smoothly and to detect issues early, it is recommended to set up monitoring and alerting tools such as CloudWatch or Stackdriver. These tools can be used to monitor the pipeline's resource utilization, log files, and other metrics, and send notifications in case of any issues.
